        <p>Despite the popularity of causative construction as a research topic, there exists a certain diversity in terms. In this section, the most significant concepts used in the present study are defined. To address the notion of argument, we resort to Role and Reference Grammar (RRG). Being specifically designed for typological purposes and grounding on functionalist basics, it seems to be particularly convenient for the present research goals.Despite the popularity of causative construction as a research topic, there exists a certain diversity in terms. In this section, the most significant concepts used in the present study are defined. To address the notion of argument, we resort to Role and Reference Grammar (RRG). Being specifically designed for typological purposes and grounding on functionalist basics, it seems to be particularly convenient for the present research goals. According to Van Valin (2005: 4), all syntactic constituents that are semantic argu-ments of a given predicate are considered core arguments or just arguments (all other con-stituents are adjuncts and belong to a periphery). All core arguments can be direct or oblique. Under the term direct, Van Valin (2005: 7) understands nominative, accusative, er-gative, absolutive and dative arguments in languages with case systems. All other cases are considered to be oblique, as are NPs marked by adpositions. In other languages, similar no-tions tend to apply (see Haspelmath: 2011 for discussion). Since our study is syntax-driven, we use overt syntactic marking and some syntactic tests for argumenthood (Toivonen: 2012) to decide upon the status of each constituent. Another question is how to label the three arguments of a causative construction. The added argument seems to be universally called causer. Alternatively, it is sometimes re-ferred to as effector. The term effector sometimes appears in the present paper for its capaci-ty to distinguish it from the term causee in an abbreviated form. Under the term causee, the participant that is supposed to perform the action is usually understood. Some studies (e. g. Dixon: 2000) also refer to it as to the former A (former agent) recalling its position in a non-causative transitive construction. As a parallel term, the former O (former (direct) ob-ject) is used for the third argument of a causative construction. This participant is also some-times called undergoer. This last option is particularly unfavourable as in RRG, where the term Undergoer is used mainly for the respective macrorole. In other words, for the three arguments of a causative construction built upon a tran-sitive verb, there are two pairs of terms following different naming conventions: causer and causee vs. former A and former O. We would like to complete the first set with a term for the third constituent. We finally picked the term theme for it since it is used for a similar partic-ipant in ditransitive constructions. Moreover, it would not confuse with the term undergoer used in RRG as the name of a macrorole.Despite the popularity of causative construction as a research topic, there exists a certain diversity in terms.
